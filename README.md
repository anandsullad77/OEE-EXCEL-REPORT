## OEE-EXCEL-REPORT

 Too many production companies do not fully utilize the data and information from ground truth data. This can cause lack of knowledge on OEEâ€™s in production departments as well as following  inaccurate product output times. OEE calculations are key for different levels of process management. 

Production tracking sheets that help companies monitor the data of their production processes at a higher level can help companies know what is out-of-control and when to address it to improve the overall efficiency of their facilities.

 Thus we created an OEE report for every production line, making it easy to understand all aspects of your factory in one position.

### OEE sheet helped to understand:
- Production tracking sheet that helped to track every project and raw material consumption on a daily basis.

- Calculating OEE at machine to plant level considering Availability, Performance and Quality factors.

- Thereby improving raw-material and Production monitoring very easily and user friendly.
